        The ActivityPub protocol is a social networking protocol based upon the
        ActivityStreams 2.0 data format.
        It is based upon experience gained from implementing and working with
        the OStatus and Pump.io protocols.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document is a proposed submission to the W3C Social working group.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The ActivityPub protocol is broadly based on the distribution of
        <i>activities</i>, described using [[!ActivityStreams]]; these
        activities are produced in response to a user performing an activity.
        Most activities are purely responsive in nature - they are produced as
        a response to a user <i>having</i> done something.
        In addition, certain activities posted by a user to their
        <a href="#outbox">outbox</a> may trigger certain operations on the
        user's behalf.
        Finally, activities may have side effects as they propogate throughout
        the social graph.
        As an example of this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A user posts the <code>like</code> activity to their outbox.
          This activity causes the user's server to perform an activity on
          behalf of the user; in particular, it adds the specified object to
          the collection of objects the user has liked.
        </li>
        <li>
          A consequence of the above activity (per
          <a href="#notification"></a>) is that the server hosting the liked
          object will be notified of the operation, and will normally add the
          activity to the list of "likes" the object has received.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the server receiving the like will distribute this activity
          to everyone it distributed the original object to.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="specification-profiles">
      <h2>Specification Profiles</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines two closely related and interacting
        protocols:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>A client to server protocol, or "Social API"</dt>
        <dd>
          This protocol permits a client to act <i>on behalf</i> of a user.
          For example, this protocol is used by a mobile phone application to
          interact with the user's social stream.
        </dd>
        <dt>A server to server protocol, or "Federation Protocol"</dt>
        <dd>
          This protocol is used to distribute activities between users on
          different servers, tying them into one social graph.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        All servers claiming conformance to this specification are required to
        implement the former protocol, and may optionally implement the latter.
        This gives three conformance classes:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Client</dt>
        <dd>
          This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
          client portion of the client to server protocol.
        </dd>
        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Server</dt>
        <dd>
          This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
          server portion of the client to server protocol.
        </dd>
        <dt>ActivityPub conformant Federated Server</dt>
        <dd>
          This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
          server portion of both the client to server and federation protocols.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
        to implementation of the federation protocol.
        In addition, whenever requirements are specified, it is called out
        whether they apply to the client or server (for the client-to-server
        protocol) or which of a pair of servers in the server-to-server
        protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="obj">
      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects are the core concept around which both [[!ActivityStreams]] and
        ActivityPub are built.
        Objects are often wrapped in Activities and are contained in streams of
        Collections, which are themselves subclasses of Objects.
        See the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/">ActivityStreams Vocabulary</a>
        document, particularly the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#types">Core Classes</a>,
        to get a sense of how this lays out; ActivityPub follows the mapping of
        this vocabulary very closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servers SHOULD validate the content they receive to avoid content
        spoofing attacks.
        In particular, servers SHOULD NOT trust client submitted content, and
        federated servers also SHOULD NOT trust content received from a server
        other than the content's origin without some form of verification.
        The general mechanism that is specified for this at this time is for a
        recipient of some referenced activitystreams object to verify the
        presence of that object on the original server.
        Other mechanisms such as verifying signatures are left out of scope of
        this document.
        (However, if other generally agreed upon mechanisms for handling
        verification become available in the future, servers are welcome to use
        those methods, in the future.)
      </p>
      <div class="informative">
        As an example, if example.com receives the activity
        <pre class="example">
         {
           "type": "Like",
           "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
           "to": ["https://hatchat.example/sarah/",
                  "https://example.com/peeps/john/"],
           "object": {
             "id": "https://example.org/~alice/note/23",
             "type": "Note",
             "author": "https://example.org/~alice",
             "content": "I'm a goat"
           }
         }
        </pre>
        it should dereference the <code>id</code> both to ensure that it exists
        and is a valid object, and that it is not misrepresenting the object.
        (In this example, Mallory could be spoofing an object allegedly posted
        by Alice.)

      <div class="issue">Mention requirement of <em>JSON-LD @context</em></div>
      <section id="obj-id">
        <h2>Object Identifiers</h2>
        <p>
          All Objects in [[!ActivityStreams]] should have unique global
          identifiers.
          ActivityPub extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the
          ActivityPub protocol MUST have unique global identifiers; these
          identifiers must fall into one of the following groups:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Publicly dereferencable URIs, such as HTTPS URIs, with their
            authority belonging to that of their originating server.
            (Publicly facing content SHOULD use HTTPS URIs.)
          </li>
          <li>
            An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object,
            which implies an anonymous object (a part of its parent context)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Identifiers MUST be provided for activities posted in server to
          server communication.
          However, for client to server communication, a server receiving an
          object with no specified <code>id</code> should allocate an object ID
          in the user's namespace and attach it to the posted object.
        </p>
        <p>All objects must have the following properties:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>id</dt><dd>The object's unique global identifier</dd>
          <dt>type</dt><dd>The type of the object</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section id="obj-methods">
        <h2>Methods on objects</h2>
        <p>
          There is a HTTP GET method an object's dereferencable URI that
          provides a mechanism to retrieve the activity.
          Servers MAY use HTTP content negotiation as defined in [[!RFC7231]] to
          select the type of data to return in response to a request.
          The client MUST specify an <code>Accept</code> header, this
          specification only applies in the selection of the
          <code>application/activity+json</code> media type.
        </p>
        <p>
          Servers MAY implement other behavior for requests which do not comply
          with the above requirement.
          (For example, servers may implement additional legacy protocols, or
          may use the same URI for both HTML and ActivityStreams
          representations of a resource)
        </p>
        <p>
          Servers MAY require authorization as specified in
          <a href="#authorization"></a>, and may additionally implement their
          own authentication rules.
          Servers SHOULD fail requests which do not pass their authorization or
          authentication checks with the appropriate HTTP error code, or the
          404 Not Found error code where the existence of the object is
          considered private.

    <section id="actors">
      <h2>Actors</h2>
      <p>
        Actors in ActivityPub are represented by HTTP URI.
        When entered directly into a user interface (for example on a login
        form), it is desirable to support simplified naming.
        For this purpose cases, ID normalization SHOULD be performed as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="issue">
        How to normalize entries without URI scheme, e.g. <em>tantek.com</em>
      </div>
      <p>
        Once the actor's URI has been identified, it should be dereferenced.

        <p>
          Actor objects are ActivityStreams objects which are subclasses of the

          The follow activity generally is a request to see the objects a user

          <p>
            The <code>outbox</code> stream contains objects the user has
            published, subject to the ability of the requestor to retrieve the
            object (that is, the contents of the outbox are filtered by the
            permissions of the person reading it).
            If a user submits a request without
            <a href="#authorization">Authorization</a> the server should
            respond with all of the <a href="#public-addressing">Public</a>
            posts.
            This could potentially be all relevant objects published by the

            A client may submit an [[!ActivityStreams]] activity to the server
            using a HTTP POST request to the dereferencable URI of the outbox
            collection.
            In this case, the request's Content-Type MUST be
            <code>application/activity+json</code>, and the request MUST be
            authenticated with credentials authorized to act on behalf of the
            user to whom the outbox belongs.
            Such submitted activities will be added to the front of the feed
            retrieved by GET requests to the same endpoint.

            The <code>inbox</code> stream contains all objects received by the

            The inbox MUST be filtered according to the requester's permission;
            this MUST include allowing read access only to the owning user.</p>

          <p>
            A server may submit a HTTP POST to the dereferencable URI of the

            This request MUST be authenticated with the credentials of the user
            identified by the <code>actor</code> stanza of the activity being
            delivered.
            The request MUST be of the [[!ActivityStreams]] content type; it
            MUST be a single activity.
            The incoming activity MUST have a valid URI as its id.
            The server MUST ensure the validity of the posted and any enclosed
            objects (generally by dereferencing the object on the originating
            server.)
          </p>

          <p>
            The server MUST perform de-duplication of activities, whereby it
            discards repeats of already delivered activities (this can occur if
            an activity is addressed both to a user's followers, and a specific
            user which happens to follow said user, and the server has failed
            to de-duplicate the recipients list, for example).
            Such deduplication MUST be performed by comparing the

      <h2>Notification and Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Notification and Delivery are two closely related acts.
        Notifications are sent to <i>objects</i> and are used to perform
        updates on the social graph, whilst delivery is the act of inserting an
        activity into a recipient <i>agent's</i> inbox.

        <p>
          Activity distribution is per the audience targetting properties from
          the [[!ActivityStreams]] specification.
          For each entry in the addressing properties of an object, the server
          shall
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the entry is a collection, then the server MUST dereference the
            collection (with the user's credentials) and deliver the object to
            each person in the collection.
            Servers MUST limit the number of layers of indirections through
            collections which will be performed, which MAY be one.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the entry is not a collection, then the server MUST perform
            discovery on the object (which may not be of person
            <code>type</code>) to discover its activity-inbox address.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the complete list of recipients has been determined, the
            server MUST then deliver the activity to each recipient.
            For a federated implementation, this must be done by performing a
            HTTP POST, with authorization as the submitting user, of the
            submitted activity body to the URI of the
            <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> collection of each recipient.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For federated servers performing delivery to a 3rd party server,
          delivery SHOULD be performed asynchronously to completion of the
          original activity submission request, and SHOULD additionally retry
          delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error.

        <a href="#followers">followers</a> collection</p>

          access to object.

          Most implementations will resolve this via internally maintained
          access control lists.
          Implementations SHOULD provide initial access to recipients specified

        <h3>Update Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Update</code> activity is used when updating an already
          existing object.
          The object should be modified to reflect the new structure in defined
          in the update activity.

      <section id="delete-activity">
        <h3>Delete Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Delete</code> activity is used to delete an already
          existing object.
          This MUST leave a shell of the object that will be displayed in
          activities which reference the deleted object.
          If the deleted object is requested the server should respond with the
          HTTP 410 Gone status code.

      <section id="follow-activity">
        <h3>Follow Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Follow</code> activity is used to subscribe to the
          activities of another user.
          Once the user has followed a user, activities shared with the Follows
          of that user SHOULD be added to the actors's inbox.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="add-activity">
        <h3>Add Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Add</code> activity is used to add the object to the
          collection specified in the <code>target</code> property of the
          activity.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="remove-activity">
        <h3>Remove Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Remove</code> activity is used to remove the object from
          the collection specified in the <code>target</code> property of the
          activity.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="block-activity">
        <h3>Block Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Block</code> activity is used to indicate that the actor
          does not want a user (defined in the <code>object</code> property) to
          be able to interact with objects posted by the user.
          The server SHOULD prevent the user from interacting with any object
          posted by the actor.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="undo-activity">
        <h3>Undo Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Undo</code> activity is used to undo a previous activity.
          For example, <code>Undo</code> may be used to undo a previous
          <code>Like</code> or <code>Follow</code>.
          The undo activity and the activity being undone MUST both have the
          same author.
          Side effects (such as adding activities to a user's inbox after a
          <code>Follow</code>) should be undone, to the extent possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are some exceptions where there is an existing and explicit
          "inverse activity" which should be used instead.
          <code>Create</code> based activities should instead use
          <code>Delete</code>, and <code>Add</code> activities should use
          <code>Remove</code>.
