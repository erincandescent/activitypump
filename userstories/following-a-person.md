## 1, 2: Meeting and following a new person

At the Acme Game Corp company all-hands, Delano and Beth discover they
have a shared interest in user interface history and both have a soft
spot for retro toolkits like Motif.  It's not every day you meet
someone else to chat about vintage GUI elements, so Delano asks if
they can chat further.  Beth hands Delano her business card and
suggests maybe they could collaborate on an upcoming project.

Delano sees that her name is "Beth Marie Bost" and enters her name
into the company people-finder.  He ends up at the following URL, her
internal profile:

  https://acmegamecorp.example/people/beth_m_bost/

That's her all right!  He decides to subscribe to her using his
desktop client.  He hits the "subscribe" button and pastes her profile
URL into the textbox.

Delano's client submits a post to its outbox declaring that Delano
would like to subscribe to Beth.  Beth is included as a recipient in
the "to" field so that her server can know to begin delivery of
messages to Delano, and the special
[public collection](http://w3c-social.github.io/activitypump/#public-addressing)
is added as a Cc: so that others might know about that subscription.


```
POST /api/user/delano_sota/feed HTTP/1.1
Host: acmegamecorp.example
Content-Type: application/activitystreams+json
Authorization: Bearer xx-bearer-token-here-xx

{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "@type": "Follow",
  "actor": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "https://acmegamecorp.example/people/delano_sota/",
    "displayName": "Delano Sota",
  },
  "object": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "https://acmegamecorp.example/people/beth_m_bost/"
  },
  "to": [{
      "@type": "Person",
      "@id": "https://acmegamecorp.example/people/beth_m_bost/"
  }],
  "cc": [{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "@id": "http://activityschema.org/collection/public",
    "@type": "Collection"
  }]
}
```

Behind the scenes, Delano's server fetches Beth's profile URL and sees
a Json-LD encoded ActivityStreams representation of a Person on the
page:

```
GET /people/beth_m_bost/
Host: acmegamecorp.example
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="application/ld+json">
      {
        "@context": [
          "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
          "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitypump"
        ],
        "@type": "Person",
        "@id": "https://acmegamecorp.example/people/beth_m_bost/",
        "following": "https://acmegamecorp.example/api/user/beth_m_bost/following",
        "followers": "https://acmegamecorp.example/api/user/beth_m_bost/followers",
        "inbox": "https://acmegamecorp.example/api/user/beth_m_bost/inbox",
        "outbox": "https://acmegamecorp.example/api/user/beth_m_bost/outbox",
        "preferredUsername": "beth_m_bost",
        "displayName": "Beth M. Bost",
        "summary": "AcmeGameCorp UI designer.  Fan of embossed widgets and 1990s video game menus.",
        "icon": [
          "https://acmegamecorp.example/media/profile_pics/beth_m_bost.png"
        ]
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content goes here! -->
  </body>
</html>
```

The server takes note of Beth's "inbox"; it needs this information so
that it can send this activity to Beth.  Now that it has it, it posts
the same activity that Delano posted to his outbox to Beth's inbox.

```
POST /api/user/beth_m_bost/inbox HTTP/1.1
Host: acmegamecorp.example
Content-Type: application/activitystreams+json
Authorization: Bearer xx-bearer-token-here-xx

/* [SAME DOCUMENT AS POSTED TO ACTOR'S INBOX ENDPOINT]
   [... YES I KNOW JSON DOESN'T HAVE COMMENTS WHAT'S UP WITH THAT] */
```

Beth's server recognizes that Delano is subscribing to Beth and
records that information so that future activities addressed generally
to Beth's followers will reach Delano.  Beth will also get a
notification in her inbox seeing that Delano has subscribed to her,
which she can use to follow back.

Since this is a public post, Delano's server will also send this
message to all of Delano's followers.

## 3, 4: Seeing that new person's content

## 5: Friends finding and following friends

## 6: Unfollowing someone
