# Inbox

From https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/User_stories#Inbox

> 1. Jake is bored at work. He checks his social inbox stream to see what his friends, family, and coworkers are up to.
> 2. Jake sees in his social stream a note by Tammy about her new apartment. Tammy is his friend.
> 3. Jake sees in his social stream a photo by Edith from her concert last night. Jake follows Edith but Edith doesn't know Jake. Edith has thousands of followers.
> 4. Jake sees in his social stream a video from Damon. Damon and Jake are both in the "Boxing Fans" group. Damon posted the video to the group.
> 5. Jake sees in his social stream a sound file from Carol. Carol is Jake's wife. The sound file is a reminder to stop for groceries after work. Carol posted the sound file only for Jake.
> 6. Jake sees in his social stream that his friend Tammy has added a new friend, Denise. Jake remembers Denise from high school. Jake requests to add Denise as a friend, too.

**NOTE:** Incomplete.  Much of this can be gleaned from the "Reading a
  user's recent posts" and "Following a person" user stories though,
  with the notable exception of groups and private addressing.  I
  believe this should be fairly straightforward though, since this is
  just changing who the addressing points to (including pointing to
  groups which are collections of recipients).

## 1. Checking your inbox

## 2. Reading posts shared between friends

## 3. Reading posts submitted to someone's public feed

## 4. Reading posts submitted to a group

## 5. Reading a post shared privately

## 6. Following someone based on someone else's follow
